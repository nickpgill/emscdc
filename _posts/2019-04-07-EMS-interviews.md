The <a href = "https://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2019-03-111.pdf">most recent EMS Newsletter</a> contains two very interesting interviews:

 * The first, on p.23,  is an interview with Michel Waldschmidt, one of our committee members. Michel talks at length about his long-term work in developing countries.
 * The second, on p.27, is with Bernadette Faye, who is one of the students in the Third World who has benefited from support from the CDC.

Read and enjoy!
