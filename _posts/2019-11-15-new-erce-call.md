ERCE (Emerging Regional Centre of Excellence) is a label awarded by the EMS-CDC
(European Mathematical Society-Committee of Developing Countries) to centres
which have achieved an outstanding level in their area of influence in research and
education, thus attracting students from other regions and countries. Indeed, the
education of master and PhD students is an asset for raising the quality and diffusion
of mathematics worldwide, and it has particular value in the developing world. ERCE
centres are among those which play an important role in training students in their
region, particularly more students from less developed areas.

With the success of this scheme the committee is now opening a new call for
applications. Details of this scheme are <a href = "/Call-ERCE-2020-EMS.pdf">here</a>. The application has to be sent by e-mail to the address **ems-office@helsinki.fi**. The deadline for this application is February 15th, 2020.
