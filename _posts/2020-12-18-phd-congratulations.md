We congratulate Elisa da Conceição Jose Maria, from Mozambique, who completed her PhD through the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Elisa successfully defended her PhD thesis entitled *Contrastes de Hipótesis Múltiples Bajo Dependencia con Aplicación a los Microarrays: Una Aproximación Bayesiana*.

Elisa's studies were partially supported by a grant from the EMS-CDC via the Simons for Africa programme.
