As of 1 January 2021, <a href = "http://zbmath.org">ZBMath</a> has become open access. This is brilliant news for people in developing countries, and we congratulate the team at ZBMath for making this happen.

One slight downside for our committee is that we will no longer receive commissions from ZBMath reviewers. Previously these commissions were used to fund some of our activities -- see <a href = "/emscdc/activities.md">here</a>. We note especially our Book Donation Programme which has received support from many people in the past. 

If you wish to support the programme or the work of the committee, please get in touch via email: *sophie.dabo@univ-lille.fr* I *pappa@mat.uniroma3.it* I *nick.gill@southwales.ac.uk*
