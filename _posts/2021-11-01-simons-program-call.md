A reminder of our ongoing program of grants in association with the Simons Foundation:

EThe African Continent is very diversified and the development of a career in
mathematics faces different and sometimes difficult progression. The
Committee for Developing Countries (CDC) of the EMS, with the support
of the Simons Foundation, has opened a program of research visits to foster
research opportunities for young and established researchers.
The aim is to promote individual career possibilities with consequence of an
improved global capacity in African academic institutions. The program is
open to all areas of pure and applied mathematics and statistics and it
is directed to fellows based in Africa.

For all applications there are four deadlines:
 * February 15th
 * May 15th
 * September 15th
 * November 15th

Applications should be submitted <a href = "https://euro-math-soc.eu/ems-simons-africa">here</a>.
