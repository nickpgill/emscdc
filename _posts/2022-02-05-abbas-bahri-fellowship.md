The Math Department of Rutgers University is resuming the Abbas Bahri Excellence Fellowship for Graduate Research in Mathematics for the academic year 2022-2023. The application's due date is March 31 2022.

Details about the announcement can be found in the <a href = "https://math.rutgers.edu/academics/graduate-program/bahrief">departmental webpage</a>. The fellowship has also been announced in the <a href = "https://euromathsoc.org/jobs/professor-abbas-bahri-excellence-fellowship-for-graduate-and-early-career-research-in-mathematics-167">EMS webpage</a>.

**Criteria for eligibility**: Awards are granted to Rutgers and/or international Ph.D students or early career research visitors in recognition of excellence in research and/or potential research impact of the proposed project. Preferences will be given to projects that promote international exchange among mathematicians, especially those that bring a positive impact to mathematical research in regions where funding for mathematical research is less available. Further preference should be given to Ph.D students or early career research visitors interested in Variational Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations, and in particular the ones Lacking Compactness. But applications from all areas of mathematics which are likely to result in and benefit from substantive mathematical interactions with our faculty will be seriously considered.

**Source of funds**: The Abbas Bahri Fellowship has been created thanks to the donations of family and friends of Abbas. Any further donations would be greatly appreciated. Instructions on how to donate can be found in the departmental announcement webpage.
