AIMS Senegal, CIMPA, EMS-CDC are organizing a two-week summer school followed by a short conference for students based in Africa. The school dates are 29/08/22 - 17/09/22 and the school will take place at AIMS-Senegal.

Two groups will work in parallel (each with about 10 members) in one of the following two areas

- Probability and statistics.

The target audience is students at the end of their master's degree and PhD students in their first or second year of their thesis. The participants will be financed for their travel and stay during the whole event. 

Specificities: This school will be extended by mentoring by the speakers throughout the thesis. We will also set up financial support possibilities to improve the thesis conditions of the participants.
