A reminder of our ongoing program of grants in association with the Simons Foundation:

The African Continent is very diversified and the development of a career in
mathematics faces different and sometimes difficult progression. The
Committee for Developing Countries (CDC) of the EMS, with the support
of the Simons Foundation, has opened a program of research visits to foster
research opportunities for young and established researchers.
The aim is to promote individual career possibilities with consequence of an
improved global capacity in African academic institutions. The program is
open to all areas of pure and applied mathematics and statistics and it
is directed to fellows based in Africa.

**The next deadline is 15th May!!**

Applications should be submitted <a href = "https://euro-math-soc.eu/ems-simons-africa">here</a>.
