The Vision of the conference is 'To celebrate the inspirational contributions of black role models to the field of Mathematics and Mathematics Education'. There will be a balance of technical talks by internationally renowned black speakers that include some detail of career paths and experience to provide a testimonial dimension. We plan to achieve a balance of career stage and gender.
